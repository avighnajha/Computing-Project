# Computing-Project
This is all of the data and my solution for the year 1 computing project in my MSci Physics course at Imperial College London. The Halpha_spectral_data.csv and distance.txt files are the data provided and the python file is my solution i.e. a value for Hubble's consatnt. The png file is the final plot that leads to the result.
